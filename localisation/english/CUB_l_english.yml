###Cuban Events###
##################

 cuba.1.t:0 "General Election"
 cuba.1.d:0 "It is now time for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people to be called to the polls to elect their leader.\nThis year, two main forces are present. The Tripartite coalition, composed of the Liberal Party, National Unity, and Republican Action, has the support of the many forces behind the 1933 revolution, particularly General Fulgencio Batista.\nAgainst them, the relatively conservative National Democratic Association, led by former President Mario García Menocal, who had led Cuba in particular during the First World War."
 cuba.1.a:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez"
 cuba_tripartite_coalition_party_long:0 "Coalición Tripartita"
 cuba.1.b:0 "Mario García Menocal"
 cuba_democratic_national_association_party_long:0 "Asociación Nacional Democrática"

 cuba.2.t:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez's Inauguration"
 cuba.2.d:0 "Miguel Mariano Gómez was inaugurated as Cuba's seventh president following his election earlier this year.\nIdeologically supported by the forces behind the 1933 revolution, he intends to continue the social reforms implemented by successive administrations since Ramón Grau's 100-day government."
 cuba.2.a:0 "We act for the [CUB.GetAdjective] people."

 cuba.3.t:0 "Mario García Menocal's Inauguration"
 cuba.3.d:0 "Mario García Menocal was inaugurated as the seventh president of Cuba, following his party's victory in the election earlier this year.\nHaving already been president from 1913 to 1921, he represented for many the former republic before the 1933 revolution. Despite his reforms during his first presidency, he was re-elected in opposition to the left coalition and consequently to the personalities behind the 1933 coup, bringing him closer to both conservative and anti-labor circles.\nOne of his other concerns will be the army, still led by Fulgencio Batista, one of the instigators of the 1933 revolution."
 cuba.3.a:0 "[CUB.GetAdjective] democracy shall be strong again."

 cuba.4.t:0 "Batista Marches on Havana!"
 cuba.4.d:0 "Declaring that Mario García Menocal's government betrayed not only the 1933 revolution but also the entire [CUB.GetAdjective] nation, Fulgencio Batista called on the army to oppose and overthrow the government.\nJ. Butler Wright, the [USA.GetAdjective] ambassador to [CUB.GetNameDef], announced that [USA.GetNameDef] supported the current government.\nThe Havana garrison has still not chosen sides but could well change everything."
 cuba.4.a:0 "The garrison sides with the government, and the coup fails."
 cuba.4.b:0 "The garrison supports Batista, and the coup succeeds."
 cuba_revolutionnary_party_long:0 "Partido Revolucionario Cubano"

 cuba.5.t:0 "President Gomez Impeached!"
 cuba.5.d:0 "Despite Miguel Mariano Gómez's promised extensive programs, he found himself with increasing opposition, particularly in the Congress and with the army chief, Fulgencio Batista, despite being his supporter during the election.\n\nFollowing the veto of the nine-cent law, Miguel Mariano Gómez was officially dismissed by Congress, and Vice-President Federico Laredo Brú was inaugurated as President of Cuba."
 cuba.5.a:0 "Let's hope he will meet the expectations of Congress and the people."

 cuba.6.t:0 "[CUB.GetNameDefCap] Suggests a War against Spain"
 cuba.6.d:0 "Declaring that the apparent neutrality that the Spanish regime is trying to show is in reality only a façade hiding secret aid to the war effort, the [CUB.GetAdjective] government has suggested a declaration of war against fascist Spain.\n\nSuch a declaration is not made lightly, especially against a currently neutral country. There is little doubt, however, that Spain's support is oriented towards the forces of the Axis."
 cuba.6.a:0 "It's time to avenge the Second Republic."
 cuba.6.b:0 "It would be too dangerous."

 cuba.7.t:0 "War with Spain Refused!"
 cuba.7.d:0 "Citing that the war is already long enough, a declaration of war against a country as big as Spain would only make it more brutal and murderous; our plan for a war against nationalist Spain has been rejected."
 cuba.7.a:0 "At least we tried."

 cuba.8.t:0 "Communist Sympathizers Attempt to Seize Power"
 cuba.8.d:0 "Many communist parties, including former exiles, have gathered in Santo Domingo today to demand the government's resignation and the establishment of a socialist system. They are very numerous and seem to have received foreign weapons."
 cuba.8.a:0 "The government falls and the communists take over."
 cuba.8.b:0 "The government holds on."

 cuba.9.t:0 "The [DOM.GetAdjective] Revolution Crushed"
 cuba.9.d:0 "Despite our support in terms of material, it seems that the [DOM.GetAdjective] revolutionaries failed to bring down the government. Those who were able to escape tell us that many of those present in Santo Domingo were arrested and may well end up executed. What should we do?"
 cuba.9.a:0 "If we cannot liberate them from the inside, we will do it from the outside!"
 cuba.9.b:0 "We will come back later."
